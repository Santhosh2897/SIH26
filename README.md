# Aegis CSI Hospital Monitor

**Aegis CSI Hospital Monitor** is a real-time, non-invasive patient monitoring and telemetry dashboard powered by Channel State Information (CSI) sensing analytics. It provides healthcare staff with continuous telemetry, motion analytics, posture tracking, and alert dispatching across hospital wards.

## Key Features

* **Live Telemetry & Vital Streams:** Real-time CSI signal processing, vital sign tracking, and dynamic waveform rendering via Recharts.
* **Intelligent Alerts & Fall Detection:** Automated severity classification (`critical`, `warning`), modal emergency triggers, and quick alert acknowledgement.
* **Dual Clinical & Technical Views:** Seamlessly switch between clinical summaries (patient status, timeline, gauge confidence) and RF technical views (subcarrier amplitude, phase shifts, link health).
* **Ward & Room Filtering:** Multi-ward command dashboard with dynamic status filtering (Occupied, Alert, Normal).
* **Enterprise Security & Compliance:** Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) workflows, Emergency Break-Glass protocols, and tamper-evident audit logging.
* **Local State Management:** Fast, predictable client state powered by Zustand with reactive mock telemetry streams.
